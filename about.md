My name is Mikhail (Michael) Vaganov, and I am a PhD student in physics and mechanics, specialising in magnetism.

During the GSoC event, I want to create something useful for researchers and to help them in simulating n-body interactions. Examples include movement of celestial objects such as planets, stars and even colliding galaxies; charged particles gyrating in alternating magnetic or/and electric fields like electrons and protons in a bubble chamber; dynamics of neutral molecules like ideal gas simulation or behaviour of sophisticated protein chains.

To conduct fast simulations of those systems in Julia I am going to develop and implement tools in [DiffEqPhysics.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DiffEqPhysics.jl). There will be created a convenient interface for n-body simulations combining solvers of differential equations with approximation methods validated from the physical point of view.
